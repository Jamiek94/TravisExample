### Travis configuration file ###

This configuration file contains the following components:

- PHP 7.1
- NodeJS 6
- Laravel
- PHPUnit
- Gulp
- NPM
- Composer
- MongoDB
- FTP

I used LFTP for deploying files through FTP. The command for this is located in the deploy.sh.

Notifications from Travis builds are send through email on succes and failures.
